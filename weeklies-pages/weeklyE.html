                <p>I learned how to make grids! This is going to be
                    especially helpful for my project 1 because I'd
                    like to use this grid structure to organize my page.

                <p><span>Discussion</span></p> 
                <p>Our discussion on online identities went well
                    (I think). I didn't intend on it being all politics,
                    but I did enjoy the discussions we had. Even though
                    politics is seen as a taboo topic, it's good to still
                    try and get people engaged; that's how healthy discussions
                    are conducted.

                    Midterm season has arrived!

                <p>Hot take: fall break doesn't really mean much.
                    It's not enough time to truly feel like you've
                    taken a break from school. It's an opportunity
                    to catch up on school work or catch up on things
                    outside of school...if you're lucky! Some professors
                    still assign assignments due right after the break.
