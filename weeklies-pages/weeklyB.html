            The most exciting part of this week was starting to get into <b>CSS!</b>
            The possiblilities for formatting have been opened up. I'm pumped to 
            work in it.

            On a sepearate note, after taking a year off of school and coding, I feel
            like I'm finally starting to get back into it! My other classes are a bit
            more familiar in the coding style since I'm working in C, Ruby, and a bit
            of Java. HTML isn't that difficult-- it just takes some time to get used
            to. And with CSS, the learning curve is a bit higher, but I'm sure I'll
            get the hang of it.
