        <p>
            The past two weeks for the course were mainly introduction to HTML.
            I have had very limited experience with this language, so although 
            much of it was a repetition of what I've learned from previous classes, 
            it was nice to get a refresher.
        </p>

        <h3>What I've learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Using Visual Studio Code</li>
            <p>
                This program is going to be very useful in my other classes as well. 
                I've used it in CSE 2431 since Vim is a pain to use.
            </p>
            <li>Text Formatting</li>
            <p>
                We've done some basic text formatting so far and I'm interested in
                learning more. My previous classes didn't dive into it since it wasn't 
                necessary, but I like making things look nice.
            </p>    
            <li>Image Insertion</li>
            <p>
                I've added an image here, but I'm guessing it won't work since the 
                image is on my local device and won't be uploaded with the assignment,
                but trust me it's here:
