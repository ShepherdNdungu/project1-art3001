            Nico: America??
            
                                        baby Shepherd: Yep. Crazy right?

            Nico: Do you even know
                  what it's like?
                  Will you be eating
                  cheesburgers and 
                  pizza all the time? 
                        
                                        baby Shepherd: I hope so! It's 
                                                       going to suck though
                                                       not being around here
                                                       anymore... 

            Nico: It's ok! We're going
                  to keep talking, 
                  keeping up with all
                  your adventures.
                  
                                        baby Shepherd: Sure!

            I haven't seen Nico since then. We never established how we'd communicate. I didn't even have a Facebook!
